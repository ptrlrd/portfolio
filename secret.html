							<h2>What we do</h2>
							<p>Heavensward is a supportive community, and here are a few of the stand-out things our members enjoy!</p>
							<div class="features">
								<section>
									<span class="icon major fa fa-users"></span>
									<h3>Community</h3>
									<p>Have you ever been a part of a stale community? Many members of Heavensward enjoy the social aspect of MMOs, and we often find ourselves in funny, engaging, and sometimes deep conversations. Many of us can often be found in our Free Company manor, discussing things like how lalafells are the best race in the game. </p>
								</section>
								<section>								
									<span class="icon major fa-comments"></span>
									<h3>Party Members</h3>
									<p>Have you run Ravana Ex more than a dozen times? Have you ever sat in the duty finder for more than half an hour? Our Free Company chat is active, fun, and full of people willing to run content with you, either level-synched or not</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon major fa-empire"></span>
									<h3>Knowledge</h3>
									<p>FFXIV offers an overwhelming amount of content, and some of it can be confusing. Want to get your money’s worth? Our community includes lots of veteran players, who were where you are once. We always try to answer questions, and guide people to resources that will help</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon major fa-gift"></span>
									<h3>Weekly Meetings & Raffles</h3>
									<p>We have a party in the basement every Sunday at 6 p.m. pacific time. We spend a bit of time discussing upcoming patch notes, Free Company initiatives, and promotions. The most important part is when we give away some awesome items! </p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon major fa fa-heart"></span>
									<h3>Free Company Buffs</h3>
									<p>We always keep Heat of Battle II active and rotate primarily between Helping Hand II, Jack Pot II, Seal Sweetner, and Meat and Mead II</p>
								</section>	
								<section>
									<span class="icon major fa fa-globe"></span>
									<h3>Crafters, Submarines, & Gardening</h3>
									<p>Do you need help crafting something? Tired of not having pots for raid? Still trying to get that cool craftable minion? Don't worry, Heavensward’s crafters can help. Like flying airships? We have those! Like playing farmville? We have three garden plots.</p>

									<h2>Our Rules</h2>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li><strong>Heavensward strives to be an inclusive community</strong>. Please use your best judgment in choosing what to post to the public chat. Be mindful of the language you use and above all else, be kind to each other. Ensure you are familiar with our core values and mission statement, which we expect all of our members to uphold. The processes outlined in the next section (see: <a href="#enforcement">“How the FC handles offenses”</a>) detail the actions Officers may take to resolve reports of posts and comments that go against our rules, core values,  and mission statement.</li>  
                                            <li><strong>Heavensward strives to be fun.</strong>  We also want to be a fun and safe space that is equally welcoming to both new and veteran players. No matter how long you’ve been playing, Heavensward members strive to assist one another without  disparaging how other members choose to progress, or their time commitment  to the game. We don’t shame players for having preferences or spending their time how they choose, even if it’s different than what you would personally do.</li>  
                                            <li><strong>Heavensward strives for maturity (kind of).</strong> Our free company is intended for adults 18 and above.  Keeping all above topics in mind, we don’t restrain members from using curses or innuendo, when appropriate. Be adults, don’t harass others or push unwanted advances. Once again, use your best judgment. Please respect an Officer’s request to tone down a particular conversation topic, it’s likely due to a previous situation or sensitivity you may not be aware of.</li>  
                                            <li><strong>Heavensward respects generosity.</strong> Heavensward collects donations of tradeable items and minions from our members, which are then raffled off to members at our weekly FC meetings. Our Free Company members work hard to give us great stuff to give away every week, and we ask that members participating in the raffle only roll for items they can use and don’t already own,, giving everyone a chance to win. Also, if you win an item during the weekly raffle, please don’t sell it! The raffle prizes are meant to be used and enjoyed by our members.</li>  
                                            <li><strong>Heavensward knows personal lives come first.</strong>  If you plan on going offline for an extended amount of time without logging in to the game, please reach out to an Officer so they can change your status to On Hiatus! There may be exceptions based on specific circumstances, and returning players are welcome to reapply for membership into the Free Company. Please notify an officer when you return so they can adjust your rank appropriately.</li>

                                    <h2>How Does the FC Handle Offenses?</h2>
                                    <p>Our Rules outline the expectations we have of our members, but keep in mind that our Officers cannot moderate 24/7. Our Leadership team will handle all complaints and reports between FC Members, and we highly recommend screenshots to back up claims. These will be reviewed by the Officers.<span style="color:red;">*</span></p>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>A warning will be issued by an officer to the offending party for first-time offenses. We make every effort to educate and inform our members who may not be aware of the impact of their words or actions.</li>
                                        <li>A second offense will result in dismissal from the Free Company and a permanent ban from our Discord.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                    
                                    <p>When approached by an officer, please accord them with the same respect and civility that you want to be treated with. The Officers work to remain aligned and consistent with our messaging, so please avoid spinning off multiple conversations with different officers on the same issue, as we’re likely already discussing it.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>The decisions of the Leadership team are final and are not open to debate, however please approach an Officer directly if you feel compelled to ask questions about how something was handled.</p>
                                    
                                    
                                    <span style="color:red;">*</span>Egregious offenses will be handled on a case by case basis by the Leadership team, and may take longer or shorter time than outlined above, depending on the situation. To make a formal complaint, please send accompanying screenshots and information on the issue to any Officer via Discord.
                                    We strive to harbor a safe space whenever possible for our members. While the officers are also players and enjoy socializing with everyone, we take our rules and disciplinary actions seriously and without bias of in-game personal relationships.
